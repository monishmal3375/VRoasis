Inspiration
The inspiration for our project is that there is more awareness of mental health now. The development of many AI Chatbots allows people to talk to the AI. We decided to make a chatbot that can specialize in providing mental health advice using AI so that it can help with any mental health problems that people are having.

What it does
This project has a chatbot that is specialized in giving mental health advice. The user can type their question on the website and submit it, and in a few seconds the chatbot will provide advice

How we built it
We built this project using HTML, CSS, and Javascript. We used HTML and CSS to create a basic website to integrate that Chatbot into and create elements for the textbox, title, and button. We used OpenAI's API Key to integrate ChatGPT into the website. We specialized the Chatbot using code so that it provides specialized mental health advice like a psychiatrist. We made the website through Replit.

Challenges we ran into
We ran into trouble when we were implementing the API into the function of the website and making the website look a certain way, but we fixed the error with the API and formatting the website by testing each piece of code.

Accomplishments that we're proud of
One accomplishment that we are proud of is successfully connecting the API to the project. Connecting the API was a challenge at first so we had to try to code it in somehow but then we successfully accomplished that goal.

What we learned
We learned how to connect APIs to Javascript and we also learned how to create a website that links in Javascript as well to make this Chatbot.

What's next for Mental Health ChatBot - Novice Hackathon
For this project, we can improve it by making the website look cleaner and we can add more features to the website to help with mental health.
